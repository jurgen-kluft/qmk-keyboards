# Layouts

## [RSTHD](https://cyanophage.github.io/index.html#rsthd)

I have spend quite some time on this layout and reached around 30 WPM with it, however I haven't taken it further to match my QWERTY speed.

[Magic Sturdy](https://github.com/Ikcelaks/keyboard_layouts/blob/main/magic_sturdy/magic_sturdy.md)

We have a [type-fu](https://type-fu.com) layout that can be used on the web to practice this layout. However, the 'magic' key cannot be emulated there, so it doesn't give you a 100% accurate representation of the layout.

```plaintext
 V M L C P           B ^1 U O  Q
 S T R D Y           F  N E A  I
 X K J G W           Z  H , . ^2
       Nav ⎵      @ Sym
```

`@` is the magic key, `Nav` is the navigation layer, and `Sym` is the symbol layer. `^1` is the main magic key, `^2` is the alternate magic key.
