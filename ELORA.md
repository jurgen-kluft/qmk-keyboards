# Elora

I have 2 Elora keyboards, one at home and one at work (since July 2024).

Both of the Elora's I use daily and have Glorious Panda (lubed) switches.

The Elora is a pre-soldered board and requires no soldering, the only DIY is to screw in the bottom and top plates and press in all the switches. It and all of its parts can be purchased here: https://splitkb.com/

## Keymap

The keymap for the Elora is almost the same as my Kyria keymap plus the top and most left row of keys.
