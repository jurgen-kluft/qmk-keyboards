# Kyria

I have 3 Kyria keyboards, two at home and one at work (since April 2021).
The Kyria's I use daily have Gazzew Boba U4 switches.

The Kyria is a DYI kit and will require soldering, although it is very doable and has an excellent online build guide. It and all of its parts can be purchased here: https://splitkb.com/

# Moonlander

My first split keyboard was the Moonlander.
